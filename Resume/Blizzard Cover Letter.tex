\hspace{1cm} As someone who has been playing Blizzard games since Warcraft III, I was thrilled to see there is a job opening pertaining to software engineering of classic WoW. I have been programming in C++ for research and recreation since I graduated high school in 2011. Some of the projects I have worked on were designed specifically to be integrated with WoW. I have always loved a challenge and try to excel at everything I do, whether it be for work or a personal project. 

\hspace{1cm} I have recently finished both mathematics and physics degrees at Michigan State University (MSU), which encompassed many years of problem solving and programming. My current work involves research at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), and IT for the physics and astronomy department at MSU. In both cases, I have been exposed to multiple operating systems, problems, programming languages, and programs in which I had to familiarize myself with and use for various purposes. In my down time, I manage a personal server which I use for various tasks including a minecraft server with real time mapping, numerous discord bots, data storage and more. This background has helped me grow in the ability to learn quick and adapt to what programs or scripting languages need used for a specific task. Along with this, I have developed a C++ software package at the NSCL and a C\# application for the advancement of the IT department I work for. Along with this recent experience, I focused heavily on graphic design in high school which has provided me a repertoire of design knowledge to aid in my developments over the years.

\hspace{1cm} I think Blizzard Entertainment is the perfect career fit for me because I have both the knowledge and experience to help maintain and improve WoW and other related projects. Similarly, I have been playing Blizzard games for over 10 years which has provided me with a large understanding of the game mechanics and changes that have come about over the many years of development. It would be a great honor to have the opportunity to discuss what I could do for Blizzard Entertainment regarding the position of C++ software engineering.

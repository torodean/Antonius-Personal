\hspace{1cm} I was thrilled to see the job posting for the IT department at MSU. As a future physicist, I am always looking for an opportunity to improve my skill-set. I am a very efficient and quick learner. I grew up building and maintaining computers mainly on a windows XP/7 OS. I have since worked for the IT department for the MSU physics and astronomy department where I gained valuable skills necessary for this type of position. Though my main area of focus the past few years has been mathematics and physics, I have done much programming in languages varying from HTML, CSS, python, php, java, C\#, bash and more. I have even created an entire encryption algorithm and developed a working windows application from scratch in C++ and C\#. I am also extremely well versed in \LaTeX, with which I wrote this cover letter and my resume with.

\hspace{1cm} Some of my previous employment included working for MSU and performing experimental nuclear astrophysics research at the NSCL. Here I was tasked with a plethora of IT projects and designing and setting up experimental apparatus' in the NSCL. Along side this I worked on simulations and created a new software package for the NSCL and future researchers to use when studying decays of radioactive nuclei using the tape station system we were developing there. Before this I did condensed matter physics research at Oakland University. Other employment includes data research at CLRS, inc, where I worked with large spreadsheets of data, helped with technological maintenance and even was tasked with unique research tasks. Following these, I worked as a campus tutor at Oakland Community College where I had to interact with many students on a daily basis. I had to be able to articulate ideas and concepts as well as identifying where others were struggling in order to facilitate the proper help. All of these experiences have provided me with a unique skill-set to be suitable for a position such as this.

\hspace{1cm} Currently, I am looking for a position while I consider the possibility of attending graduate school. I look forward to hearing from you and if you have any questions or further inquiries, you can look to my attached resume for details and my contact information.

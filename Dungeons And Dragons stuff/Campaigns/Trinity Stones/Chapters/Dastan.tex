\section{The 'Escape' of Dastan}

Whilst in Tempestas, an ingenious plan to bust out of prison is underway by the infamous Dastan. Dastan was one of the most wanted criminals for over 9 years when he was finally captured and thrown in prison within the last week. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Dastan wanted. He is to be put to death 9 days after he was thrown in Prison.

Out of nowhere, a huge explosion. Another immediately following from the opposite direction. Moments later, a distinguishable horn, screams, and more. Two guards from every post head off towards the explosions. It’s a prison break. The city goes on further lock down and no one can leave. 

Dastan Van’Cleef is one of three triplets. Each one refers to himself as Dastan and act as one being but are able to perform miraculous crimes because there are three of them. Dastan is also after the Trinity Stones after learning of the holy crusades the Celestials have been starting in surrounding regions. He has read the Book of Celestas and has a great understanding of the past events that it could be referring to or future events it could be predicting. He has a great understanding because him and his brothers essentially work as one and thus are able to develop a greater understanding of events around them. Dastan getting thrown in prison was meant to disband the team assembled by the Nobleman of Tempestas to hunt down Dastan. This team was formed because of the great crimes Dastan was able to commit against the nobleman and higher officials throughout the lands. After their disbanding, the other two Dastan’s are able to secure a prison break and use the overall distraction as a distraction to rob the Tempestas bank and the Nobles Vault. The Dastan’s have secured passage from Tempestas via one of the nobleman’s own ships. This is one of the ships able to travel out of Tempestas within the lock down due to the ranking of the nobleman and urgencies of the message they need to send (About the desecration of neighboring towns).

Dastan (1) got himself thrown in prison. This caused the VanForce (anti-Dastan special operatives) to be disbanded until his execution. However, Sir Lancelot helped Dastan escape (due to a negotiation with Dastan (2) while Dastan (1) was in prison). Whilst in prison, Dastan (2) was breaking into the Nobles Vault. Dastan (3) was tasked with distracting the guards and creating a fake bank robbery himself. He hired some thugs from the Brawlers Guild who created some key disputes in different city regions and threatening the Kings safety. At the same time, Dastan (2) was impersonating a guard officer in the attempt to stop the bank robbery by Dastan (3). Dastan (2) was to secure vault goods but while 'preventing' the bank robbery he magically sealed himself within the vault itself and has been waiting ever since (only a few days). With the chaos of distractions, the prison break, and the impending holy crusade threat distracting the majority of the guards (part of the campaign). 

Dastan was aware of the holy crusades happening in other regions and timed this all accordingly. Once the prison break occurred, Dastan (2) came out of hiding and robbed the Nobles Vault. He was able to walk right out with what he wanted. Dastan (1) immediately met up with Dastan (2) when leaving prison and handed off the goods following his escape. Some of the goods he acquired are key to securing their passage out of the city. One such item is a Golden Samsun (A gold crafted flower made with magical craftsmanship and covered in jewels that Zuba de Hut desired obtaining from another Noble). During this, Dastan (3) was heading to the Brawlers guild to secure an entrance to the Brawlers guild.

\begin{commentbox}{A Brothers Experience}
	Due to the experience that the Dastan brothers have together, They can use their abilities to assist eachother in combat.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  If a ranged attack misses, Medivh can use Matter-Shift Displacement to relaunch the attack with a new attack throw.
		\item If a ranged attack is directed towards a Dastan, Nathanos can attempt to deflect the arrow away by sending an arrow to intercept and by succeeding a DC16 hit.
		\item The brothers can form a mental communication with each other to perfectly create strategies against others.
		\item Van'Cleef can stab using his daggers at a distance using Medivh's Matter Displacement.

\section{Creation of a Trinity}

\begin{quotebox}
	``In the beginning, The Celestials created the Heavens and the Earth. A singularity of reality from whence space was formed, energy was made, and time unraveled. A trinity of reality to be seen forever.''\footnote{A quote from the book of Celestas.}
\end{quotebox}

No matter the story of beginning, it all arrives at the same principles. Space, time, and matter. A trinity of reality stemming from the creation itself. For none can exist without another, and in existence all must come simultaneously. These forces of the cosmos work in unison and cannot be broken from each other. At least that's how we've perceived it.

\section{Creation of the Stones}

\textbf{It is said} that those who can harness the power of reality itself would have unrivaled power. The outcomes of reality itself would be for them to decide. Unfortunately to harness the trinity would be to harness the universe, a space incomprehensible to perceive. In ancient times, there existed an organization known as the Celestial Guard. This group of people extended through all races and across the entire world. A common goal among them was to understand and tap into this trinity. Through centuries, hidden mysteries of the universe began to be unraveled, bringing forth the secrets of magic and powers known today. The Celestial Guard was the primary source of the advancements of knowledge. It was a one world coalition driven to further knowledge. It is said that the knowledge and understandings of these ancients vastly surpassed anyone from todays era. 

Over time, the Celestial Guard became segregated. After discoveries pertaining to parallel realms, there became hidden agendas. A civil war on a global scale ensued among the Celestial Guard. A war on such great of a scale that the majority of knowledge was lost as a consequence. As it is told, the council of seven (the last leaders of the Celestial Guard) had unlocked an understanding that has never before been known. Through this they were able to create what we call the Trinity Stones. 

A minuscule part of reality was harnessed into three stones, space, time, and matter. Each stone is unique in appearance but all mesmerizing in sight. The stones are said to bring immeasurable powers to the users. Not by their powers themselves, but through the understanding they bring. The stones were created as a milestone in understanding. Unfortunately, due to the war and the hastily actions of the council, the stones were sealed away. A powerful spell was placed on the stones such that they cannot be found save all together. If any stone is found apart from a counterpart, reality itself will bend around the stone, hence placing it back in hiding. 

The stones have a unique ability to act on their own each in a unique way. Each stone has a unique spherical look. The stones are cut in such a way that they radiate energy and appear somewhat translucent0. The stones each have remnants of the others glow within it and parts of each stone will turn dark when the others are not near. The stones naturally repel themselves like that of similar magnetic poles.

\section{The Space Stone}

The space stone controls elements pertaining to spacial events. The space stone mainly causes objects to randomly move location. The space stone can bend and warp reality and change the shapes of matter itself. The space stone can effect gravity and forces around objects.

\section{The Matter Stone}

The matter stone controls elements pertaining to power and lack thereof. The matter stone primarily causes illusionary events such as glowing ponds and rivers as well as transforms beasts into both stronger or weaker than they usually would be. Matter of any form can be created or destroyed in any way in any location. Similarly, matter can change phase and properties.

\section{The Time Stone}

The time stone controls temporal events. The stone primarily will cause objects to teleport into different locations within the flow of time. Within the confines of this stoens power, time can speed up or slow down with time dilation. It can adjust it's direction and even trap things in temporal bubbles.

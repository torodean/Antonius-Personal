\section{Creation of a Trinity}

\begin{quotebox}
	In the beginning, The Celestials created the Heavens and the Earth. A singularity of reality from whence space was formed, energy was made, and time unraveled. A trinity of reality to be seen forever.
\end{quotebox}

No matter the story of beginning, it all arrives at the same principles. Space, time, and matter. A trinity of reality stemming from the creation itself. For none can exist without another, and in existence all must come simultaneously. These forces of the cosmos work in unison and cannot be broken from each other. At least that's how we've perceived it.

\section{Creation of the Stones}

\textbf{It is said} that those who can harness the power of reality itself would have unrivaled power. The outcomes of reality itself would be for them to decide. Unfortunately to harness the trinity would be to harness the universe, a space incomprehensible to perceive. In ancient times, there existed an organization known as the Celestial Guard. This group of people extended through all races and across the entire world. A common goal among them was to understand and tap into this trinity. Through centuries, hidden mysteries of the universe began to be unraveled, bringing forth the secrets of magic and powers known today. The Celestial Guard was the primary source of the advancements of knowledge. It is said that the knowledge and understandings of these ancients vastly surpassed anyone from todays era. 

Over time, the Celestial Guard became segregated. After discoveries pertaining to parallel realms, there became hidden agendas. A civil war on a global scale ensued among the Celestial Guard. A war on such great of a scale that the majority of knowledge was lost as a consequence. As it is told, the council of seven (the last leaders of the Celestial Guard) had unlocked an understanding that has never before been known. Through this they were able to create what we call the Infinity Stones. 

A minuscule part of reality was harnessed into three stones, space, time, and matter. Each stone is unique in appearance but all mesmerizing in appearance. The stones are said to bring immeasurable powers to the users. Not by their powers themselves, but through the understanding they bring. The stones were created as a milestone in understanding. Unfortunately, due to the war and the hastily actions of the council, the stones were hidden away. A powerful spell was placed on the stones such that they cannot be found save all together. If any stone is found apart from a counterpart, reality itself will bend around the stone, hence placing it back in hiding. 

The stones have a unique ability to act on their own each in a unique way. Each stone has a unique look which three sections. The stones are cut in such a way that they all fit together. The stones each have remnants of the others glow within it and parts of each stone will turn dark when the others are not near.

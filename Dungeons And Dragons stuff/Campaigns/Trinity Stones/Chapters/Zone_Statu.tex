\section{The Statu Peninsula}

The Statu peninsula (commonly referred to as just Statu) is largly un-mapped area. As the name suggests, Statu is a peninsula that cannot be accessed from foot to the north. It contains very dense forestation and mountainous regions to the northern area that are not possible to travel through. The south is colonized by Aurushire where a small number of people settle. There are generally a small number of visitors to Statu, save those who are trading and working with the mines to the East of Aurushire. The best way to access Statu is through the Aurushire port.

To the West of Aurushire, there is a large forest that is significantly less dense than the northern regions. To the north of this is very dense un-explored forest and mountainous regions. Directly north of Aurushire is The Pluvian Forest. This region is not very often visited. Strange occurances pertaining to what some call 'strange spatial events' occur in The Pluvian Forest which generally ward off visitors. To the southeast of Aurushire, there is a hostile tribe of river Naga which attack travelers and visitors on sight. Because of this, the area to the southeast and the forest regions to the East of Aurushire are unexplored. What is known of this region is that there is a large valley that leads from the Naga camps into the mountain/forest region.

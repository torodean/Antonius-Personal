\subsection{Session 05 Summary: Leaving Tempestas Behind}

\subsubsection{The Quest of Dastan and his Companions}

\subsubsection{The Battle of Tempestas Harbor}

When last conscious, all of the party members were sleeping in the Blue Recluse Inn save Darris who was back home. Little did he know he was being watched all night and Dastan and the others knew precisely where he was. While still asleep, each one of the party members were treated with a sleep inducing compound so that they would not awake to movement or noises. When comatose, the party members were strategically transported to a ship awaiting Dastan within the Tempestas Harbor. Dastan and his companions concealed the members in crates so as to seem inconspicuous when loading them aboard.

Last they were aware, the party members were closing their eyes to get a nights rest. Yzom was the first to awake. He awoke to being shaken by Turelyon whom handed him a vial of green liquid and told him to give this to the others. As he wakes, he sees the others laying asleep next to him. As he rocks back and forth he realizes they are in the underbelly of a boat. Yzom questions whether he should wake the others, but after hearing some distinctive cannon fire from above, he decides to wake the others.

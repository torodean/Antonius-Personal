\subsection{Session 06 Summary: Awakening on The Jungle Coast}

\subsubsection{`Visions' of Dreaded Meanings}

Gashtai slowly comes to consciousness. As the light enters his eyes, a ship appears in the distance. The ship approaches slowly as Gashtai wakes from the daze of the storm. He does not see anyone else around, but only wreckage from the ship. As he comes to, he notices a figure atop the ship. He then quickly recognizes the ship as the Cerberus. Still tied to the mast of the ship, he unties himself and prepares himself for what could be coming. The ship approaches right to his location and the figure on deck becomes apparent as Gashtai's father. ``You had one job Gashtai. And you let him free. Dastan was your only target. And you failed. You don't realize how important this was that you took him out.'' He pulls a bow out of a quill, pulls back on the drawstring, and releases. Gashtai's sight goes black.

Ferrous slowly coming to consciousness. Floating there in the cold sea, adrift on pieces of wreckage from the ship. No other crew members in sight, and nothing but vast sea. The storm has calmed, but the sky is still dark.	After a moment of floating, Ferrous begins to pray. But through the lids of his eye, he sees a light, and when opening his eyes, an angelic being descends from the sky in front of him. The being starts talking to him about how he was sent to convert Tempestas to the ways of Apollo. After a moment of a peaceful tone, the eyes of the angelic being start to glow bright and the being begins to raise it's voice to the sky and shout.

\begin{quote}
	``The enemies will turn Tempestas into a stronghold! With it they will send out angelic powers throughout Orilla and destroy all those who oppose them. The only way to keep them at bay has been lost with time. You were sent to convert Tempestas, and you failed.''
\end{quote}

The being calms down and looks at Ferrous. Reaches out with an arm of light, and upon touching Ferrous on the head, his sight turns to darkness.

Victor, slowly coming to consciousness by a voice, begins to lift his eyelids. He is laying in a boat, and someone is calling out his name with a gentle voice. He begins to come to and looks up to see his daughter. She is the same age as she was when she was taken.

\begin{quote}
	``Dad... Wake up dad... Dad... Dad are you alright? It's okay now dad I'm here.''
\end{quote}

Both him and his daughter Samilah are floating in a lifeboat. The storm has calmed and the sky has cleared. The horizon is light with thin cloud cover and an orange sunset. After a brief conversation of introduction and Victor coming to consciousness to understand what is going on, his daughter continues.

\begin{quote}
	``Dad... I had to come to let you know something. I had to let you know that I'm safe dad. I'm safe with the Celestials. They took me in and have been watching over me. Dad I wanted you to know that they are taking care of me. They are keeping me safe. Their words are truth and the others you are with seek to destroy them. You can't allow this to happen dad.''
\end{quote}

She reaches out with her right arm and places it gently on the left side of his face. As she makes contact, his sight begins to fade to darkness as he leans to one side.

Yzom, slowly coming to consciousness. The sky still black from the storm, ship debris floating in all directions and no sign of the party. He looks up to see a hand stretched out. It's a large black man, the man who ran the orphanage he grew up in. As Yzom wakes into consciousness, he recognizes the man immediately. The man takes his hand and begins to talk to him with a tone of importance.

\begin{quote}
	``Yzom... You have to follow your heart my child. Not everything is as it seems. There are dark secrets around the path you follow and you must see through to the conspiracy. The fate of the world is balancing on fine threads and you are on a path that leads to great importance. Everything is not as it seems.
\end{quote}

The man disperses and Yzom is left afloat. After looking down in the water, a mermaid approaches with its arm stretched out. Yzom reaches to it, and the mermaid pulls him into the cold depths. As they get farther down to darkness, the mermaids face turns to a devilish siren being. And then he is pulled into the darkness until all fades to black.

Candy barr awakes, in the debris of the wreckage. A large ship approaching in the distance with many voices shouting out. As they get closer, and Candy begins to awake, the sight of her family is revealed. The ship is her family calling out to her. The ship approaches right by and a rope is thrown. Candy does not move, does not reach towards the rope. A few of the members jump in and rope her up. They are all vastly excited to see her and asking how she has been doing and how her adventures are going. In the midst of the fellowship, they all pause and say ``Why did you let us die Candy?'' A small little girl walks up with a sad face and says ``Save us Candy.'' Her family grabs her with ropes, ties her up and pushes her to the end of a plank. Their faces all have turned dark and grievous. At the end of the plank, the little girl approaches again, still with a sweet yet sad face. ``Save us Candy. You still can.'' Then Candy is pushed into the waters and immediately falls into the darkness of the depths. As everything turns black, Candy loses consciousness. 

\subsubsection{Treading into The Unknown Forest}

The party members awake washed up on a dirt beach. There are many rocks, shells, and pieces of the ship scattered along a large area of shore that they are on. The party members are all spread out and a little ways away from each other. Gashtai is still tied to the mast of the ship but quickly unties himself. Candy Barr, Yzom, and Gashtai all approach Ferrous after seeing him. Victor finds his way to the rest and they have a brief discussion about what happened. To the east, a large rock face and huge sheer cliffs lining the sea line. To the north, thick and dense jungle that appears to only end at a sandy beach as to where it appears the tide comes to. Behind the beach area, large cliffs and mountainous regions.

After a moment, Victor decides to tread into the jungle. Gashtai follows. After a short distance traveled, a growl nearby is heard. Victor, out of reaction casts his attack towards the sound, damaging the bushes and jungle in that direction. As they continue walking, they hear the sound again and the same occurs. In a quick turn of pace, two mountain lions appear out of the dense jungle and attack as if starved. The first, leaps out towards Victor, but catches its claw right between two thick branches, giving Victor an opportunity to blast the beast. The second, ran out from behind Gashtai and took a bite at him. The first quickly broke from its branch binding and mauled at Victor. Victor's instincts came in and he was able to quickly defeat the beast with his magical potency. Behind him, Gashtai swiped at the beast and completely missed. The beast leaped onto Gashtai and soaked its teeth right into his shoulder and neck. Gashtai blacked out instantly. From the commotion, Candy Barr and the others had ran into the forest to see what chaos was ensuing. Candy bar pulled out her axe, took a large overhand swing at the beast, but caught her axe on a branch and lost control. The axe fell back onto herself injuring her.

In a fearful turn of events, as Victor turns from his battle, Gashtai is being drug away soon to become this lions lunch. Victor, with his quick thinking jumped onto the lion and began to curse its flesh. As the lion backed away through the brush, quickly retreating, Victor continued to curse the beast until boils appeared and its flesh decaying. The life of the beast quickly faded as his wounds increased and skin began to break open. Victor had killed the second beast as well, followed by drinking the pus of his wounds to cleanse his battle scars.

Ferrous finally caught up to the area where the others were and saw the finished battle. He revived Gashtai and healed the others. Yzom attempted to come along behind them, but as they all ran off, Yzom tripped on a low vine and fell face first into a thorn bush, covering his face with thorns. After plucking most of the thorns out of his face, he attempted to run into the forest to catch up with the others. This time, tripping on the same vine and falling into the same thorn bush a second time. Luck was not on his side and while the others conversed, he sat back and plucked thorns out of his face. This time keeping the thorns in a small pouch he had. Candy barr quickly retreated to the beach area while the others stayed in the thick jungle. 

After briefly recovering from the battle of the lions, Victor and Ferrous are bitten by snakes. The poison lingered in their blood spreading throughout their bodies. Slowly weakening from the effects, Victor had pulled out a book that survived their shipwreck (that he had purchased earlier from an alchemist shop) and began searching for the ingredients for a generic venom antidote. He found some of the ingredients but not all. During this, Yzom was determined to travel into this forest despite two falls into thorn bushes. He clutches his fists and joints, stands with his feat together and back straight, and then begins to show his true acrobatics with front flips, double back-springs, somersaults, and perfectly aimed dives right through the jungle. With precision and accuracy, he leaps forwards deep into the jungle and far surpasses the others by heading in a different direction.

While on the shore, Candy encounters Clime, who had just washed up on shore. Clime, asked her where the others went and trotted off into the jungle searching for them. After finding them through some back and forth yelling, Clime finds them and is able to heal them both from their poison. At this point, three Dire wolves that they had heard earlier approach them. There was a fourth but it caught a glimpse of Yzom traveling by and broke off to take a look. The single wolf attacks Yzom after seeing he is all alone. The three others attack the group. After Gashtai almost dies, the group defeats the three wolves and Yzom defeats his single wolf. Yzom heads back towards the group and catches up with them. Seeing their injuries they all heal each other as much as they are able then leave the jungle. Seeing Candy Barr set up a stable shelter on the beach, they all decide it's as good of a time as any to setup camp and stay on the beach prepared for the night. Unfortunately, they did not pay attention to the signs they noticed earlier that there is only a forest line due to the apparent tide that comes in each night...

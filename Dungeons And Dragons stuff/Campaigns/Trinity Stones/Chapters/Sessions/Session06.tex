\subsection{Session 06 Summary: Awakening on The Coast}

\subsubsection{Visions of Prophetic Meanings}

Gashtai slowly comes to consciousness. As the light enters his eyes, a ship appears in the distance. The ship approaches slowly as Gashtai wakes from the daze of the storm. He does not see anyone else around, but only wreckage from the ship. As he comes to, he notices a figure atop the ship. He then quickly recognizes the ship as the Cerberus. Still tied to the mast of the ship, he unties himself and prepares himself for what could be coming. The ship approaches right to his location and the figure on deck becomes apparent as Gashtai's father. ``You had one job Gashtai. And you let him free. Dastan was your only target. And you failed. You don't realize how important this was that you took him out.'' He pulls a bow out of a quill, pulls back on the drawstring, and releases. Gashtai's sight goes black.

Ferrous slowly coming to consciousness. Floating there in the cold sea, adrift on pieces of wreckage from the ship. No other crew members in sight, and nothing but vast sea. The storm has calmed, but the sky is still dark.	After a moment of floating, Ferrous begins to pray. But through the lids of his eye, he sees a light, and when opening his eyes, an angelic being descends from the sky in front of him.

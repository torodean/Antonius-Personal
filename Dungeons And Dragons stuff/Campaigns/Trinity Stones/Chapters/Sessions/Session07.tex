\subsection{Session 07 Summary: The Eternal Marsh Part 1}

\subsubsection{The Binding of Flesh and Eternity}

Darris never arrived on shore with the rest of the party. Similar to the visions of the rest of the party, Darris had his own interesting encounter.

A dark tendril from the depths of the sea caressing his unconscious face. As he comes to, he feels nothing but the pain of the ship mast he is impaled with. Already having lost a vast amount of blood and continuing to lose more, he is light headed. Cloud cover from the storms are still filling the sky with darkness, but a hint of sunshine fades through just on the horizon give the area just enough light to make out shapes and features. Darris comes to seeing wreckage in every direction scattered abroad. Apparent as though nothing survived the wreckage. His vision slightly starting to blur as the pain of his wounds linger. The thoughts of death arise in his seemingly lifeless body.

The tendril on his face starts to slither and another comes from the depths of the ocean and wraps itself around Darris' lifeless body. You are too weak to shift yourself and see what is happening, but in a matter of moments, it's grasped you and begins to drag you into the depths. You hear and feel a deep rumble and then a voice is clearly heard through the waves of water around your immersed body.

	``This is not your grave... But you are welcome to it.''
\end{quote}

As the slow and deep voice fades, Darris' vision turns black and fades to dark. Coming to a second time, he cannot see anything but black. The feel of strict binding around his body, the rest of his limbs numb. Slime covered, and dripping sweat. The area humid and wet. Almost as though the air is made of warm vapor. A deep rumble approaches again, and from feet in front of him a voice trembles and echoes throughout the cavern. 

\begin{quote}
	``You are but flesh and faith, and your mind has been deluded. There is much talk, and I have listened, through rock, and metal, and time. Now I shall talk, and you shall listen. The prophets promise you freedom from a doomed existence, but you will find no salvation with them. Those who built the faith knew what they wrought. Do not mistake their intent, or all will perish as they did before.''
\end{quote}
	
The creature has connected with Darris' nervous system and can understand his thoughts at this point (unknowing to Darris). After it finished speaking the above, it can sense that Darris doesn't really have an interest in what is being said. The creature squeezes Darris more tightly with its grasp.

\begin{quote}
	``If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you. There is still time to stop the key from turning, but first it must be found. Fate had us meet as foes, but the enemy will make us brothers. I will restore you and those you knew if you embark on this sacred journey.''
\end{quote}

Darris still being gripped by the tendrils of the creature, he only has enough energy to speak one thing. After a moment of hesitation... "I.... I accept." A deep grumbling noise travels through the damp cavern. Darris' eyes suddenly see a faint amount of light and the creature in front of him becomes visible. 

\begin{quote}
	``Silence fills the empty grave, now that I have gone. But my mind is not at rest, for questions linger on.''
\end{quote}

A sharp tendril hovers in front of Darris' left eye. In an instant, it pushes itself into his eye quicker than reflexes could perceive. A sharp pain knives through all of Darris' veins and in a moment he blacks out. The great beast was impregnating Darris with its offspring. A parasite that intertwines itself with Darris' Nervous system.

\subsubsection{Drifting Down The Beach}

The players left off after their adventures in the jungle and decided to camp along the beach line for the night. They discussed taking shifts for keeping watch over the night and Victor and Gashtai were up first. After a matter of moments, Victor pulled out the Book of Celestials he has and began reading. After about three lines, he dozed off due to being very tired from the earlier battles. Gashtai was able to stay awake for a short time, but fell asleep after about an hour of keeping watch. After all had fallen asleep, the tide began to come in and raise onto the shore.

Before anyone noticed the tides coming into them, a medium sized rogue wave approached. While they were still all asleep, the wave crashed into the shore, pushing the party into the tree line and then pulling them back into the sea. Some of them awakened underwater gulping the salty sea water while others awoke being pushed with the water immediately taking to swimming and struggling to stay afloat. In a manner of seconds the party was grabbed by the current as as they struggled to stay afloat, they could see the tree line traveling by as they were washed further down the shore. Only a few minutes go by and the current has pulled them miles down the beach. Fortunately, the current flow reaches a curve around this section which releases tension just long enough for the party members to break free and swim back to shore.

The party collects themselves in a new and unfamiliar region of the beach. They are unsure how far down they've been carried by the current but they do notice a large difference in the surroundings. The beach is becoming more muddy. The tree line is thinning out and turning into more of a forest rather than a dense jungle. The sky is dark and there is a fog off into the distance further down the beach. The party looks around at their new surroundings. Yzom notices something off in the distance laying on the ground and trots off towards it. The others see and as he approaches, he finds a bottle. A sealed glass bottle with some paper rolled inside of it (a message in a bottle perhaps). He opens the bottle and tries to pull the message out. His fingers cannot grasp the small papers within so she smashes the bottle on the ground and removes the glass from the documents. Inside he finds three documents. The first is a simple map of Orilla. The map seems to be very detailed and has various colors that could reference forest, snow, desert and ocean/seas. The second is a map of some small regions which are labeled as to where they are. Yzom doesn't notice at first that there is a connection between the two maps. The third document is a distress letter written by Captain Belshrak Nie from Tel'Drassil.

\subsubsection{An Unexpected Change}

With only the light of the moon and few stars leading the way, the party knew they were still worn out and needed to head out for rest. The clouds cover is such that the light from the moon is coming in and out as the clouds cover the lights of the heavens. When covered, the players cannot see much, but in a moment when it was uncovered, they saw something they did not expect to see. There was Darris, washed up on the shore. They ran over to see his condition and immediately noticed something strange. Darris appeared different than any of them remembered in that his left eye was almost parasitic or alien like. He had small purple veins surrounding his eye and leaving from the area into the rest of his head. Darris awoke to see the party over him, not all of them happy to see him due to his past actions.

Darris begins interacting with the party members, some of whom want to kill him. His actions seem lighter and more friendly than before. Some of the members, such as Gashtai interpret this as perhaps a change of heart (possibly even caused by the parasite). The others believe he is still just the same as he was before. Clime uses his magical senses to see what type of spirits reside within Darris and gets a sense of conflict of both a good spirit and evil one (unsure which is which). Darris continues to act as if he has had a change of heart while some of the party members discuss either removing the parasite from his head or killing him (or both).

After a long argument, Darris is restrained and they attempt to take a blade to the eye. A deep "Nooo" is heard by Darris as his body seems to react on its own and move out of the way. He takes no note of the voice and plays it off cool (after pulling himself out of Climes grasp). The party members who dislike Darris use this as an excuse to justify that the parasite needs to be taken out. They attack Darris, knocking him unconscious. Gashtai, in his concern revives Darris. Darris comes to, and remains calm even though just being brought to the brink of death. The party strikes him again! Darris is knocked down, his heart stopping. A few seconds go by and Gashtai, being unsure of what they should do revives Darris again. Darris continues to remain calm and the party considers that he may be telling the truth and have turned good. 

The party ties Darris up and Clime carries him as they continue on. They are still exhausted and need to find a place to rest. Some of them are intelligent enough to suggest not setting up a camp or resting on the beach again like before as the tide may still be coming in. They start to head into the mainland. The sky is dark and there is heavy cloud cover. The moon is out as a three quarters full waning crescent but the light from it is fading in and out as the clouds overpass it. 

Candy Barr throws out a strange idea of holding hands. The rest of the party is on board to try it so no one gets lost except for Gashtai, whom refuses. As the party pesters him to hold their hand, he holds to his refusal. He holds up his hand towards them giving them a firm no. As he does so, Yzom slowly sneaks around the back of him and grabs onto his hand whole still holding onto the others. As they all hold hands, the light from the moon comes through the clouds illuminating the party. Gashtai does not notice at first but then realizes he has been tricked as he can see the party twisted around him and Yzom holding onto his hand. He pulls his hand away in slight frustration. The moon flows back behind a cloud. The players begin insisting that they need to hold hands again. Gashtai refuses and starts to walk on ahead. Again, the party maneuvers in such a way that Yzom can grab Gashtai's hand without him realizing. The moon comes from behind the clouds and illuminates the party once again. Gashtai realizes this is happening again and pulls his hand free and treads forward. This time the light stays illuminating the party for a bit.

They head off into the forest region and find some trees that some of them can climb into. They set up camp and take a long rest. Nothing happens to them during this rest, but Darris awakes to find himself untied from his restraints. He greets the other members upon waking by hugging Gashtai. Gashtai pushes him away and the others are concerned how he got untied. They retie Darris and he allows them to do so. Clime decides he will carry Darris along with the rest of them but as soon as Darris is put on Climes back, he collapses due to his fatigue.

\subsubsection{A Change in Terrain}

They continue their journey and travel further down the region. The terrain changes over time and becomes less of a forest and more of a muddy swamp area with short dead trees all over. The fog is thickening. After a while of traveling, they have entered a marsh region. The terrain is becoming difficult to walk over and the fog has thickened to slim their few to their immediate area. As they continue to tread through the rough terrain. As they travel the terrain becomes full on marsh (traversable though) with a thick fog limiting their view distance to mere feet. As they listen to their surroundings, whispers and strange sounds come from within the fog.

\subsubsection{Dangers Lurking Within the Fog}

As they enter and traverse the thick fog, the first living things they come upon are a group of Myconids. The Myconids turn and look at them all. Darris takes off running towards the Myconids and attempts to give the large one a big hug. The Myconid takes this as a threat and takes a large swing towards Darris. Darris ducks out of the way and runs off into the thick fog away from the rest of the party. The largest Myconid reaches down and grabs a large pile of mud and turns towards the others. Victor, before the party can react holds his hand out and says ``wait!'' The party stands still starring at the Myconids. The Myconids stare at the party, not moving in for an attack. As the tension builds, the mud drops from the Myconids hand revealing a large rock that the Myconid picked up. They have not attacked. The party decides to slowly walk away and around the Myconids in a non-provoking way. They successfully leave the area of the Myconids and head off further into the fog.

The party discusses a formation plan for if they are ambushed by anything. They stand in a sensible formation with all angles covered as they traverse through the marsh. A few hours later, the party encounters three water weirds. They spring up out of puddles surrounding the party and attack the members. The party successfully fights off the weirds, but as they do, the water from the puddles bounces from one another as if combining and a larger, more powerful water weird is born. The party similarly fights this off with little struggle. They continue through the marsh for 2 days, coming across various hostile things to fight off, but nearing the other side of the marsh.

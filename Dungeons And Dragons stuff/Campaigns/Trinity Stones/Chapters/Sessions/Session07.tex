\subsubsection{The Binding of Flesh and Eternity}

Darris never arrived on shore with the rest of the party. Similar to the visions of the rest of the party, Darris had his own interesting encounter.

A dark tendril from the depths of the sea caressing his unconscious face. As he comes to, he feels nothing but the pain of the ship mast he is impaled with. Already having lost a vast amount of blood and continuing to lose more, he is light headed. Cloud cover from the storms are still filling the sky with darkness, but a hint of sunshine fades through just on the horizon give the area just enough light to make out shapes and features. Darris comes to seeing wreckage in every direction scattered abroad. Apparent as though nothing survived the wreckage. His vision slightly starting to blur as the pain of his wounds linger. The thoughts of death arise in his seemingly lifeless body.

The tendril on his face starts to slither and another comes from the depths of the ocean and wraps itself around Darris' lifeless body. You are too weak to shift yourself and see what is happening, but in a matter of moments, it's grasped you and begins to drag you into the depths. You hear and feel a deep rumble and then a voice is clearly heard through the waves of water around your immersed body.

As the slow and deep voice fades, Darris' vision turns black and fades to dark. Coming to a second time, he cannot see anything but black. The feel of strict binding around his body, the rest of his limbs numb. Slime covered, and dripping sweat. The area humid and wet. Almost as though the air is made of warm vapor. A deep rumble approaches again, and from feet in front of him a voice trembles and echoes throughout the cavern.

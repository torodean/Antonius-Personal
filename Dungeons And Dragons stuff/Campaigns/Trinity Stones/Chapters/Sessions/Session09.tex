\subsection{Session 09 Summary: Discovering Aurushire}

\subsubsection{The Awakening Water}

After settling in near the mountainous cliff, most of the party prepared for a long rest. While off guard, the water near the members began to bubble and slosh. A young water elemental could sense the dying presence of Darris from the blood he left behind as they traveled through the waters. In a moment, the great elemental formed out of the water. Water blades were swirling around the creature and shadows formed a menacing looking face. The creature appeared as close to the party as it could and caught them off guard.  Taking the creature to be a threat, the members immediately started to attack. The creature, being battered at took to a defense and started to fight back. As the party swiped and battered the elemental, it formed large hammers with its fists, smashing and grappling both Clime and Gashtai. With a water hammer containing them, the creature then took a swing towards Victor and Yzom. Gashtai was thrown into Victor as the elemental smashed at him. The creature took a swing at Yzom but he was able to maneuver out of the way. Clime was slammed on the ground and broke from the bonds of the creature. The creature, although very tough, was no match for hte numbers the party contained. The creature was swiftly defeated leaving only bangs and bruises on a few of the party members. 

\subsubsection{The Demise of Darris}

Darris is laying on the ground, battered and beaten. He is missing an arm, a toe, and is sitting on the edge of death. Yzom, who is on first watch whispers to Ferrous, ``I'll wake you when it's time to kill him.'' Ferrous is so fed up with Darris he storms towards him. ``I'm doing it now.'' He rushes over to Darris, places his hand over his mouth and shocks him. Darris is immediately knocked unconscious. A tear drips from the parasitic eye of Darris as well as Apollo onlooking from the heavens. Yzom pulls out his short sword and drives it straight through the alien-like eye. Victor notices the members attacking Darris and just before Gashtai can join in for a killing blow, he interjects pushing Yzom and Ferrous away from the two of them. He then persuades them to not kill him yet. He makes a compelling argument to wait unti leveryone is asleep and they step down. Clime, onlooking these events, begins to pray to determine whether or not he should interject. Darris is out cold and balancing on a thin hair of life. Moments pass by and his heart continues to beat slowly. His body has taken more than any normal man should be able, but somehow is still miraculously clinging on.

As everyone else falls asleep save Vinia whom is on first watch, Gashtai retreats into the shadows while Yzom and Ferrous stay up waiting. When they perceive the others to be asleep, they move in and make their move. Ferrous stealthily fires his magical attacks towards Darris, igniting the body in an eldrich flame. Yzom removes his sword from the eye and strikes at the corpse searching for the killing blow. Before Ferrous and Yzom can get the killing blow in, Gashtai comes from the shadows and hammers his scythe down into Darris killing him and inflicting his corpse with necrotic damage. The body starts to decay and mummify like that of a zombie. They all know the deed has been done, as Vinia stands by and watches questioning whether this was right or not. Ferrous and Gashtai feel a sigh of relief.

\subsubsection{An Eternal Warning of Retribution}

Upon the death of Darris, Gashtai begins to suck up his soul from the corpse. As Gashtai sucks the soul of Darris, he feels a strange presence of a second soul, the Neokoros creature within Darris. The creature has been killed alongside Darris, and Gashtai also begins to suck the soul of it. When he does, he relives Darris' encounter with the Eternal Neokoros as if he were inside of Darris during the experience. After seeing the event occur, Gashtai is knocked out cold and falls backward to the ground. As the party begins to sleep and rest, a few of them have some interesting dreams.

The awake members finalize their preparation for a long rest and prepare for bead. Yzom and Vinia are on first watch.

As ferrous falls asleep, he feels a sense of accomplishment for finally ridding himself and the others from the murderous Darris. His righteous nature at this point has all but drifted away into the background. When asleep, a dream came upon him. In this dream, an angelic light approached him from the sky. This being showed the face of a woman and spoke to him as if from Apollo. 

\begin{quote}
	``What has troubled you my child?''
\end{quote}

Ferrous is confused as to whom the being is, knowing that Apollo is a man, he doesn't think that he would appear as a woman. He replies, ``I thought I was on my own and that I was abandoned.'' His little faith is comes off as all but displeasing.

\begin{quote}
	``You of so little faith! Did you not know that I was with you. You have hardened your heart and done what is good in your own sight. For that, I will not protect you from the wrath that seeks you. Be warned, repent and sin no more.''
\end{quote} 

The angelic being put it's hand onto Ferrous' forehead and the dream ends. He awakes and briefly questions whether the dream mattered or not. Stuck on the idea that Apollo is a man and so that must be just a dream, he disregards it to be anything but real.

In his sleep, Clime also comes upon a dream. In his sleep, his dream seems vivid and real. It is that of him looking upon Darris' corpse. A single tear falls from the eye of the corpse and then the body starts to come alive. The corpse bursts into a hulking rage. It's muscles expand and the skin rips off from the necrotic damage done to it. The muscles come alive and the corpse begins to speak in a deep voice.

\begin{quote}
	``You have condemned my only son. Now your salvation cannot be won. Unfortunate for you, I have concluded. And now all but perish, you will as deluded.''
\end{quote}

Clime falls back in terror and immediately awakes form the nightmare.

Gashtai, in his sleep comes upon a vivid dream. It begins with him awaking from his sleep and looking onto the corpse of Darris. Due to the necrotic damage he dealt to the body, the skin has all but began to decay and fall off. The corpse ages quickly and all the skin decays to nothing leaving just the bones and the Neokoros within. He can see the creature stemming throughout Darris' corpse and as he is observing it as comes alive. The Neokoros parasite begins to move and slithers towards Gashtai. He quickly backs his way up and the creature slithers faster towards him and jumps onto his face darkening his vision. Now unable to move, the next thing in sight is the face of the Eternal Neokoros. The creature speaks to him in a deep thunderous voice.

\begin{quote}
	``You have condemned my only son. Now your salvation cannot be won. Unfortunate for you, I have concluded. And now all but perish, you will as deluded.''
\end{quote}

At this point he awakens to being kicked in the side.

Yzom, in his sleep comes upon a vivid dream. It begins with him awaking from his sleep and looking onto the corpse of Darris. Due to the necrotic damage he dealt to the body, the skin has all but began to decay and fall off. The corpse ages quickly and all the skin decays to nothing leaving just the bones and the Neokoros within. He can see the creature stemming throughout Darris' corpse and as he is observing it as comes alive. The Neokoros parasite begins to move and slithers towards Gashtai. He quickly backs his way up and the creature slithers faster towards him and jumps onto his face darkening his vision. The creature speaks into his mind.

\begin{quote}
	``You have condemned my only son. Now your salvation cannot be won. Unfortunate for you, I have concluded. And now all but perish, you will as deluded.''
\end{quote}

Yzom then awakes from his nightmare.

After Victor awakens the next morning, he sees Darris' corpse laying dead on the group next to Gashtai. He questions the others as to what happened and they tell he him died. His corpse is burnt and blistered from the necrotic plagues. Victor, being obsessed with death, decides to examine the corpse. He essentially dissects the tiefling corpse, which he is perfectly familiar with from previous experience. He immediately notices that the parasite that was his eye is spread throughout his body with nerve tendrils all over his muscular system. As the party prepares to leave, they toss rocks onto the corpse. Some of the rocks are larger and cause the organs to burst and splatter over the ground.

\subsubsection{The Friendly Greeting of Aurushire}

After finishing up the party headed back out into the Shimmering Flats towards the town which Bird Person saw earlier. After a calm but wet hike, the party sees a boat off in the distance to their left and a large windmill on a cliff to the right. Ahead of them is a large hill leading up out of the water and to the area of land on the same height as the windmill is placed. They head up the hill. As they reach the top, farmland can be seen over the region and a man there working to greet them. ``Hello visitors!'' They began a dialog with the man who gave them a brief description of the town ahead and where they are. They pulled out their maps and he pointed them to the region of Statu. Gashtai recognizes this as where they want to be in the search for what is called the Trinity Stones. Some of the other members are not sure if that's what they want to do because they aren't quite sure what he's talking about. Others simply note what Gashtai says. They depart the man and head into town.

They discover a little about hte layout of the town and head from the outskirts directly into town. Their first encounter is with a man named Throom. Throom is half owner to Tracey's armory and takes shifts working hte shop. He is currently on duty but comes out of his shop to meet the visitors. Arryn, one of the watchers of Aurushire comes walking towards the visitors from the port area. Arryn is able to guide some of them to the Inn and Tavern while others head to the town library looking for information. Some of them head to the Inn to buy a room and drop off some of their belongings, then heading into town to discover what is in the area. A few of them head to the library where they meet what looks like a small child. He is sitting and reading and informs them that the library is kind of open to the townsfolk to use as needed. The party finds a few books that they are interested and take them to use. One of which is simply titled Prophecies. Another, which is the last book in a 64 book set on elves.

After visiting the library, the party gathers at the tavern/pub to relax and decide what they are doing next.

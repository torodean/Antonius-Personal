\subsection{Session 01 Summary: Chaos in Tempestas Part 1}

\subsubsection{Securing Passage to Tempestas}

Ferrous begins on a holy voyage with some fellow Apollo followers. His journey to Tempestas was rather long and a few stops for supplies were made on the route. During one of the stops, they came across Gashtai who was looking to buy passage to Tempestas. Although Ferrous and the rest of the crew could see Gashtai's outward shady look, they were only a day out from Tempestas and decided it would be a good opportunity to expose him to the ways of Apollo and also make some extra money by providing passage to Tempestas. 

Meanwhile, the spice trade routes in the area were making their routes around the nearby islands. The spice trade is also a common known `taxi' service as there is generally room in the holds of the ship for people to travel along with the spices. The aroma of the ship is ever changing due to the spices being traded, imported, and exported from various regions. Sometimes the aroma becomes so strong you can taste new flavors just through breathing which provide for an interesting experience when traveling. A particular ship, The Bar-Kokhba was making its way towards Tempestas and accepting passengers heading that way. Victor Anderson, Yzom, and Candy Barr all managed to hitch a ride via this ship to the city of Tempestas. Victor and Yzom managed to pay their way onto the ship. Candy Barr was able to trade her box of spices from her sons wedding, which is when she learned one of the vials contained poison. She bartered to keep the poison but traded the rest away. This poison could explain the sudden death of her family members after the wedding. 

While on the spice trade route, many conversations arose between the various hitch hikers. Victor developed somewhat of an annoyance for Candy Barr and could not wait to be free of the tight enclosure of the spice ship. Candy seemed to show her nosy and loud nature during this ship, where she overheard conversations she wasn't apart of and made accusations of things she heard such as Yzom stealing a purse/bag from another traveler. Victor managed to strike up a conversation with a traveler regarding death as well as gathered the history of Candy's past misfortunes pertaining to her family deaths. While on the Apollo ship, Apollo Eleven, Ferrous made a great effort to preach to Gashtai. Gashtai, however, developed an annoyance for Ferrous and for the most part remained silence trying to sustain his patience as he would be in Tempestas soon. 

\subsubsection{Arrival in Tempestas}

As the Bar-Kokhba rolled into port, there was a surprising amount of guards on patrol at the docks. The guards were searching vessels and approving arrivals before they could enter Tempestas. The normal crew of the Bar-Kokhba was not used to this which implied there was something up. Upon discussion with the guards, Victor learned that the city was on lock-down and high alert due to events happening to the southeast of Tempestas. The ports were currently closed to leaving and only opened to entrance for supply ships. Upon arrival, the ship was searched. Victor and Candy were questioned as to what their purpose in Tempestas was and they were allowed to walk free. Unfortunately, Yzom, who has spent a good amount of time in the past in the city, was recognized by one of the guards (temporarily acting as militia). This particular guard worked for one of the city nobles Sir Lancelot and knew that Yzom had succeeded on pulling cons on him and his regions in the past. For this reason, the guard apprehended Yzom. Him and a few other guards took Yzom to the Tempestas prison while the others were free to roam about.

As the guards dragged Yzom away to the prison, Victor decided to intervene and attempt to persuade them otherwise. He attempted to perform an illusion on one of the guards to make it appear as though he had leprosy. Within the immediate guards, this appeared to be effective. However, a nearby guard happened to see the whole thing and called out Victor's craftiness to calm the other guards. Victor was warned what would happen if he tried to mess with the city guards and Yzom was finally taken off to the prison.

The Apollo Eleven arrived into port with Gashtai and Ferrous. The ship was similarly inspected and the members questioned as to why they were entering Tempestas. Even though the city was closed to all entering except supply ships, these particular guards (militia) were fond of the religious establishments of the city and always welcomed new outlooks. For this reason, the ship and crew were allowed to enter and both Gashtai and Ferrous were free to roam the City. Ferrous was directed to the Tempestas Cathedral in the Cathedral square. Gashtai wondered off to explore the city. Victor entered a scribe shop and negotiated for a map of Tempestas. He managed to use a swift illusion to exchange a cheap map for a more detailed map and ended up leaving the store with a detailed map of all the major locations of Tempestas.

\subsubsection{Exploring Tempestas and the Church Incident}

At the docks of Tempestas, the greatness of the city can be seen. A large towering wall surrounds the sea walls of the city with two entrances through the walls. These entrances are large gated sections in the walls. To get to the gates, a large ramp must be traversed which is filled with people, guards, and traders. Candy Barr was not use to the vastness of a large city like this. In the moment of appreciation for all of the large gates, walls, and grandiose appearance of the city, she lost sight of what her duty was. She walked up to the city entrance and began wondering around and creepily following people, unsure of what to do. Gashtai encountered Candy Barr as she started following him after entering the city gates. They had a brief encounter and he was very nice to her which gave her a likening of his character. Gashtai continued off to explore the city. He asked a guard if he had known where to find Dastan and found out that he was in the prison. He convinced the guard that Dastan was his father and he came to bear witness to his inevitable execution. He was heading towards the prison.

Ferrous was on a mission, to preach the word of Apollo. Immediately after leaving the docks of Tempestas, he headed to the Cathedral. He traveled through the gates of the city and made a B-line to the Tempestas Cathedral. In his mind, he would make a grand entrance. He would magically blast the doors open, ignite all of the candles and enhance their light, and yell hail Apollo in great glory. In his mind he had a perfect vision of how to make a grand entrance. When approaching the front of the Cathedral, his vision became more clear. He prepared for his grand entrance and WHAM! The doors flung open, all of the candle light enhanced, and a glorious yell, "Hail Ap..." A bloody screen followed. There flung on the ground was a pregnant woman, screaming in pain. The door had been flung right into her stomach. Her shirt starting to turn red with the stain of blood. Ferrous was frozen in disbelief. His countenance fell away in an instant. In a panic, Ferrous attempted to heal the woman, which succeeded from an outside appearance, though the woman was still screaming. "My baby! My baby!" The high priest of the Cathedral came running over, knelt down, and prayed to his gods. In a spectacular display, a blue aura surrounded the woman, and her screams ceased. Her expression with that of belief and astonishment, she appeared as though everything was now well. In a manner of shock, Ferrous turned and ran faster than any other dwarf had ran before in a direction away from the Cathedral. Over the river, and through the town, to escape Ferrous was seeking. Candy Barr and Gashtai both saw the small dwarf booking it.

\subsubsection{The Prison Break and Escape of Dastan} 

Clime, Darris McStickle, and Dastan were all in the Tempestas prison in nearby cells. Clime entered an interesting but brief conversation with Dastan, whom seemed like he was just where he wanted to be. Dastan remained silent for the most part, but reassured Clime that he would not be in here much longer. Clime had no idea how he had even ended up in the prison and had none of his stuff with him. He was a holy man, unsure of what he could have done. He had no memory of being thrown in here either. After a brief time after Clime's awakening, Yzom was brought into a cell just down the way and thrown in a cell. Yzom and Clime established a brief line of communication and Dastan remained in the shadows secretly smirking. 

After another short amount of time, Sir Lancelot entered the area and headed to Yzom's cell. He began to laugh at the misfortune of Yzom and rubbing it in that he was finally in prison. Not remembering what he had done to Lancelot, Yzom played it cool, but had no idea how he would escape from here. Dastan called to Lancelot, to which Lancelot turned and focused on the real reason he was at the prison. He walked over to Dastan and had a quiet discussion with him which the others only heard as whispers. Sir Lancelot opened his coat, pulled out small bags and placed on on each cell as he walked out. Dastan murmured "Get back." and each bag placed on each cell lit with a light of fire, and moments later the iron of the bars started melting through the bright glow of thermite. The cell doors began to ajar and each prisoner was free to leave.

Darris was the first to run out, followed by a few other prisoners and then Dastan. The other sections of the prison had apparently also been let loose and a large mass of criminals were running out from the prison. The militia working at the time were low in number and struggling to apprehend all of the escapees. Within moments, there was a crowd of criminals running from the prison through the city streets blending with the people of the streets. Dastan had vanished and Yzom was running out of the prison trying to blend with the crowd. City horns started blowing and guards started leaving their normal posts to head towards to prison area.

After seeing the chaos that is incurring directly ahead of Gashtai, he turned around and headed back to Candy Barr after running off from his previous conversation with her. Victor, upon leaving the scribe store, ran off to a secluded area and began summoning a familiar. Yzom and Clime met up while running from the prison and distanced themselves from all of the guards they could see. Yzom, being still in his normal clothes came up to a tailor shop who was working on some custom projects for his clients. While distracted he stole a pile of clothes from the shopkeepers patio and ran off to give them to Clime. Fortunately, there was some items that fit Clime and they were able to get him out of his prison clothes. Through using their surroundings as camouflage, the two were able to remain relatively hidden from the passing by guards looking for the escapees. Ferrous entered the scene when all of the chaos was occurring and retreated to the scribe's shop so as to escape from the crowd. He was similarly able to purchase a map but a less detailed version that Victor had. He began chatting with the scribe about some stories and myths and continued to do so for a bit.

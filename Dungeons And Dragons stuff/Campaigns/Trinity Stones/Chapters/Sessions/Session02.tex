\subsection{Session 02 Summary: Chaos in Tempestas Part 2}

\subsubsection{The Fortune Teller and Shady Figure}

Gashtai met up with Candy Barr away from the chaos ensuing from the prison break. Candy Barr decided she liked Gashtai as he was nice to her but Gashtai was indifferent about her and was mainly focused on finding Dastan who appeared to have vanished in the chaos. An elderly woman exited a nearby shop and approached Gashtai and Candy. This woman focused out Candy and enticed her to have her fortune read to her. This woman had a surprising knowledge of both Gashtai and Candy which intrigued Gashtai. After entering the fortune teller's shop, Gashtai and Candy sat down and the process began. The mysterious fortune teller's knowledge concerned Gashtai and enticed Candy Barr. The teller knew about Candy's past and what had happened to her family. She gave Candy a hope of a way in which her family could be brought back, which Candy took as a way to remedy her duties to reproduce and loneliness that she has been feeling. The fotune teller told of a legend of a great artifact hidden on Statu which had power over temporal (time) events which could be used to go back and save Candy Barr's family. As payment for the fortune that Candy was given, the teller demanded payment and accepted the vial of poison as an exchange. The fortune teller did not seem interested in Gashtai other than him not having the luxury of gaining more insight into the situation.

After leaving the fortune teller's place, Gashtai noticed a shady figure off in the shadows of an ally between the shops. The shady figure tried to get Gashtai's attention and succeeded in drawing him over. After a brief conversation, the shady figure made Gashtai think he is needed somewhere and left him with a riddle.

\begin{center}
	At the time one less than three, meet at the hour of three.
	
	At the location of the Arachnid, that is colored by the sea.
\end{center}

This riddle decodes to mean "Meet at the Blue Recluse at eleven." Gashtai was convinced that Dastan will be at this meeting and therefore was intrigued and dedicated to being there are the correct location and time. 

\subsubsection{Traveling to the Graveyard}

After summoning his familiar, a hawk owl, Victor decided to head towards the Tempestas graveyard. On his way, he managed to notice Yzom and Clime poorly hidden between some bushes along on of the canal paths. 

\subsubsection{Apprehension of Ferrous}

After the guards learned about Ferrous, and how he must have been the Apollo follower that the Fortune teller had warned the city people about just weeks ago, they took him into custody. 

\subsubsection{the Streaking Tiefling}

Darris, after frantically running away from the prison and hiding in the crowd realized he is still wearing his prison clothes. Rather than keeping a low profile, he stripped completely naked, grabbed some leaves from the ground to cover himself, and ran back to where his home was across town. His roommates were not super shocked as they were use to his shenanigans, but immediately demanded rent, since he has been absent from paying for a while. Darris happened to have some gold hidden among his personal items there in which he was able to pay rent with. He dressed and gathered his items and then proceeded to sneakily steal back his rent payment from his roommates belongings. He packed the leaves he had into his things and ran off towards the graveyard.

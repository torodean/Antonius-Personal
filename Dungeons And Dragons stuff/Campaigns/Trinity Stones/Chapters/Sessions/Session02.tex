\subsection{Session 02 Summary: Chaos in Tempestas Part 2}

\subsubsection{The Fortune Teller and Shady Figure}

Gashtai met up with Candy Barr away from the chaos ensuing from the prison break. Candy Barr decided she liked Gashtai as he was nice to her but Gashtai was indifferent about her and was mainly focused on finding Dastan who appeared to have vanished in the chaos. An elderly woman exited a nearby shop and approached Gashtai and Candy. This woman focused out Candy and enticed her to have her fortune read to her. This woman had a surprising knowledge of both Gashtai and Candy which intrigued Gashtai. After entering the fortune teller's shop, Gashtai and Candy sat down and the process began. The mysterious fortune teller's knowledge concerned Gashtai and enticed Candy Barr. The teller knew about Candy's past and what had happened to her family. She gave Candy a hope of a way in which her family could be brought back, which Candy took as a way to remedy her duties to reproduce and loneliness that she has been feeling. The fortune teller told of a legend of a great artifact hidden on Statu which had power over temporal (time) events which could be used to go back and save Candy Barr's family. As payment for the fortune that Candy was given, the teller demanded payment and accepted the vial of poison as an exchange. The fortune teller did not seem interested in Gashtai other than him not having the luxury of gaining more insight into the situation.

After leaving the fortune teller's place, Gashtai noticed a shady figure off in the shadows of an ally between the shops. The shady figure tried to get Gashtai's attention and succeeded in drawing him over. After a brief conversation, the shady figure made Gashtai think he is needed somewhere and left him with a riddle.

\begin{center}
	At the base one less than three, meet at the hour of three.
	
	At the location of the Arachnid, that is colored by the sea.
\end{center}

This riddle decodes to mean "Meet at the Blue Recluse at eleven." Gashtai was convinced that Dastan will be at this meeting and therefore was intrigued and dedicated to being there are the correct location and time. He was also very hasty in determining the true meaning of the riddle. 

\subsubsection{Traveling to the Graveyard}

After summoning his familiar, a hawk owl, Victor decided to head towards the Tempestas graveyard. On his way, he managed to notice Yzom and Clime poorly hidden between some bushes along on of the canal paths. Yzom and Clime were also spotted by the city guards in which they started to pursue them as suspects of escapees. The guards caught up to them and began to take Clime into custody after realizing he was in the prison when the prison break happened. Yzom managed to convince the guards that he was not one of the prisoners and managed to walk away freely. Victor followed closely as Clime was dragged away by the guards. As the guards took him towards maximum security, they passed by Ferrous. Clime called out to Ferrous as a man of Apollo. The guards took notice of him and stopped him to question him. 

Prior to these events, the fortune teller of the town had foretold the murder of a baby by a man of Apollo, and thus when Clime came to town weeks earlier, he was arrested. However, Ferrous was not very good at keeping secret his feelings of what he had done and the guards knew immediately that Clime was not the man of Apollo that the fortune teller had spoken of. The guards released Clime and apprehended Ferrous as soon as they discovered the truth. As Clime was now free, he wandered off not knowing where to go. He approached the northern region of town where the chapel and graveyard were. Victor followed closely and decided to meet up with Clime after seeing him freed from the guards. Victor convinced Clime to travel with him towards the graveyard because he had something important for him.

\subsubsection{Apprehension of Ferrous}

After the guards learned about Ferrous, and how he must have been the Apollo follower that the Fortune teller had warned the city people about just weeks ago, they took him into custody. Seeing as the main Tempestas prison was damaged and under siege, they would have no choice but to take him to maximum security. They lead him that. To get to maximum security, they need to pass the canal on a boat. Because of this, they have temporary cells that they can place prisoners in while waiting for the next available boat to transport them. On their way to maximum security just along the canal, they moved a torch on the city wall opening up a small room in the side of one of the large city walls. They pushed Ferrous into the opening and sealed the wall. Ferrous could only see a small amount of faint light through some grate at the top of the room, but other than that it was completely empty and fairly dark. Ferrous began to pray to Apollo, unsure of what would happen next.

At the northern side of town, the high priest of Tempestas had heard news of a Celestial Prior visiting the town. He hastily made his way towards the front gates of the city to meet the prior. On his way he was intercepted by guards and told of Ferrous and his capture. The priest stopped at the cell near Ferrous on his way to meet the prior. After the wall opened and he looked upon Ferrous, his heart felt warmed as he sensed great sorrow in Ferrous' heart. He looked upon Ferrous, placed his hand on him and stated ``repent and sin no more.'' He motioned to the guards to release Ferrous and continued onward to the city gates.

\subsubsection{the Streaking Tiefling}

Darris, after frantically running away from the prison and hiding in the crowd realized he is still wearing his prison clothes. Rather than keeping a low profile, he stripped completely naked, grabbed some leaves from the ground to cover himself, and ran back to where his home was across town. His roommates were not super shocked as they were use to his shenanigans, but immediately demanded rent, since he has been absent from paying for a while. Darris happened to have some gold hidden among his personal items there in which he was able to pay rent with. He dressed and gathered his items and then proceeded to sneakily steal back his rent payment from his roommates belongings. He packed the leaves he had into his things and ran off towards the graveyard for unknown reasons.

\subsubsection{Disturbing the Graves}

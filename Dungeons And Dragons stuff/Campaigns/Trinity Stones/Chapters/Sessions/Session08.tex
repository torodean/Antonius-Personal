\subsection{Session 08 Summary: The Eternal Marsh Part 2}

\subsubsection{Darris Verses the Marsh}

Immediately after provoking the Myconids, Darris took off running in a direction away from the party. He ran off into the thick depths of the fog. He approached more Myconids and continued running past. He was running through a Myconid village. At one point he saw a deep burrow. He turned and ran off away from the entrance. Within a matter of seconds later, he took a step with his right leg, which sunk straight into the muddy waters, up to his knee. Almost getting stuck, he was quick enough to pull his leg right back out. However, the mud was so thick that it grabbed at his leg almost pulling him deeper in, but instead pulling off his right shoe. As he pulls his leg from the grasping mud, he loses his balance and falls face first into the mud. Unfortunately he falls right into a sharp rock and slices his forehead open and knocking him out cold.

Unaware for how long he was out for, Darris comes too. Unable to see due to the mud covering his face. He wipes away what he can with his similarly muddied arms. He clears enough of the mud away from his eyes to have some sight back. He can tell there is blood all over the mud beneath him. The gash on his face all but clotted with mud. After looking up, he immediately sees a large and menacing snake-like creature. Darris takes off running as fast as he can, moving through the muddy terrain, leaving his boot behind and not looking back. As he hears the whispers of the fog, he begins to become overwhelmed and driven slightly mad.

He runs in a single direction for about an hour. He stepped on what appeared to be a clam and sliced his right foot open. He is completely lost as to his sense of direction and running low on stamina as his movement has slowed to a limping walk. He continues to tread forward before coming across a large creature bathing in the mud. A Large, almost round creature, with multiple tentacles protruding from it's body. It is swiveling and slightly bouncing in the mud as if bathing. As soon as Darris sees the creature he tries to stop and not make noise. In that instant he was on his injured foot and swiftly let the other down, right onto a small root, snapping it and making a loud noise. The creature immediately turns all of his tentacles towards Darris, each with an eye on the tip looking straight into Darris' soul. The creature turns itself around and Darris becomes utterly frightened. His vision becomes dizzy and he faints before the creature. 

The next memory of Darris is that of himself standing on unfamiliar ground, He is holding the arm of what looked like one of the Tentacles from the creature with an eye on the end of it. He is drenched in some sort of goo and has a distinct memory of eating a large amount of seaweed and reeds but completely unsure where the memory came from. As Darris takes his first step forward, his balance is even further off than it was before. He looks down and realizes he is missing a toe. He listens to the whispers of the fog as he takes a deep breath in. He immediately notices a deep breathing sound and slowly turns behind him seeing a large Xorn creature. The creature looks extremely angered with Darris for unknown reasons and immediately grabs him and starts treading off into the fog. Only thinking of himself, Darris does not notice what's in the other hand of the Xorn.

\subsubsection{The Elf and a Xorn}

Out of the thick fog, the remainder of the party hears something approaching. Before they could hide, a large beast appeared, a Xorn. The beast was holding Darris in one hand, and an elf in the other. The best, looking extremely dangerous, charges towards the party. They brace themselves and prepare to attack. Darris sees the others and makes an attack towards the mouth of the creature. He gets the bright idea of lunging into the large open mouth of the creature to attack it from within. Darris shifts his weight towards the beast and takes a stab towards its mouth. The beasts grasp is too strong for him to shift and he ends up swinging his arm towards the mouth of the creature and right onto a tooth. A tooth of the creature pierces through Darris' forearm. He cries out in pain. The others join in on the attack and start to throw furious blows at the creature.

The creature is furious and fights them back. As it swipes at the party members with it's huge arms, it bites at Darris. The creatures teeth sink deep into Darris' shoulder and bites his entire arm straight off. Darris is instantly incapacitated. The wound mysteriously scabs over in a matter of moments. Clime approaches the beast and slams it with a thunderous blow, knocking it back and onto the ground. When the beast falls, it's grip on the elf releases and she starts attacking the creature. Victor and Gashtai work together to pummel the creature with necrotic damage, killing it. The eye in the center of the creature bursts from the necrotic plague it's been inflicted with. The fallen beast releases it's grasp on the unconscious Darris and its arms fall to the ground. 

Clime runs over and heals Darris bringing him back to consciousness. The party begins to communicate with the elf that the Xorn was carrying. They discover her name is Vinia and begin questioning where she is from. She tells them she is from this region. The party members examine the body of the beast. Xorns are known to be attracted and able to sense precious gems and metals, which is how it ran straight for them. Victor is the first to examine the body. He finds gems and gold hidden under the skin flaps of the beast. A few of the party members decide to take a claw or tooth from the beast as a memory for its defeat. After they have done all this, Clime begins to skin the beast for meat. The party magically cleanses and cleans the meat so they can keep some of it as rations. All of the party members take some portions of the beast. Darris, not interested in being friendly anymore, begins to threaten the party members and throwing things at them. The thick fog has began to drive him crazy. Ferrous, Gashtai and Yzom take this as the last straw. They are not going to let Darris stick around for much longer. In their hearts, they have already decided to rid themselves of his pestering. 

\subsubsection{The Bonding of Classes}

Throughout the time they have been spending in the marsh, they have began to converse and tell about each other. A few of them also asked if the others could teach them a bit about magic. Yzom reached back into his memories and realized he had a chance to learn about some magic as he has always desired. Ferrous similarly decides that his cleric ways are not serving him any good and decided to learn about some of the ways of a warlock from the others.

With his new found spells, Yzom attempted to detect any magical presences nearby. A small vine began illuminating to his sight. He turned invisible and was unable to be seen by the others. He walked off towards the root and the party notices his footprints tread off. They followed the prints and then notices a root being pulled at as Yzom tugged to remove the root from the ground. The party decided to join in and try to pull the root out with no luck. Then Gashtai comes over and pulls the root out with little effort just by applying some leverage. Yzom turns visible again after they squabble about why they just pulled a root out of the ground. Yzom asks for the root and they chip away at it. Yzom notices a ring of Radiant resistance grown into the wood. He equips it and they head forward in the marsh.

\subsubsection{The Shimmering Flats}

After another few hours, the fog has noticeably slimmed and the ground begins to harden away from it's muddy terrain. They continue traveling farther and reach an area where the ground is hard and rocky and there is a short layer of water along what appears to be a huge flat area. The fog is still presence but not inhibiting their sight significantly. They begin to travel along the flats and after they are removed from the fog, the shine of the sun causes the water covering the flats to shimmer. They have unknowingly entered the Shimmering Flats. The party continues for a while and Victor summons Bird Person (his familiar) to scout ahead. After a bit of time, Bird Person notices a wind mill far off. The sun is setting on the horizon and the party decides they will head to the cliffs to their right and take a rest before heading further towards the windmill. After reaching the cliff face, Gashtai begins to pray to his god as to whether or not he should remove Darris from the party. After finishing his prayer, a large earthquake comes and rocks begin to fall upon the party from the huge rock face. A few are hit by rocks and badly injured including Darris whom is crushed by a large stone and taken to the edge of life. Gashtai interprets this as a sign of approval from his god.

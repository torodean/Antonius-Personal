\section{The Pluvian Forest}

\subsubsection{About the Region}

The Pluvian Forest is the name of the forest that is located to the North of Aurushire. The forest is known for strange spacial occurrences happening within it. Those who travel into The Pluvian Forest do not generally return or will return very confused or changed.

\subsubsection{Unique Forest Dynamics}

The Pluvian Forest is largely effected by the contents of the Spati Aethereu Thalamun (Aethereu). It is a normal forest in itself but it's close proximity to Aethereu makes this region dangerous. The forest is heavily affected by the space stone such that visitors can be lost for weeks while only traveling through a few days worth of terrain. Similarly, the time stone has the strongest connection to the space stone and thus has a great influence on the area. Often, travelers find the days lasting longer or shorter than usual. The energy stone has an effect on this region which amplifies the effect of the other two stones.

\begin{commentbox}{Irregular Days}
	As a byproduct of the time stone effecting the region, often the days find themselves to be shortened or lengthened due to the time stone effect from Aethereu. As a DM, you can determine periodically if there is any effect on travelers by rolling a 1d20 and succeeding a DC11 time throw. If failed, roll a 1d20 to determine the effect on the party.

\begin{commentbox}{Irregular Creatures}
	As a byproduct of the time stone working in conjunction with the space stone effecting the region, often creatures of objects of strange origin can appear in the area.

\subsubsection{Navigating The Pluvian Forest}

In order to successfully navigate through The Pluvian Forest and find Aethereu, the party must follow a simple set of instructions, while not getting turned around by the irregular occurrences. These set of instructions may be given to the party in a variety of ways (see below). 

\begin{commentbox}{Successful Navigation}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Guidence of Time] When nature calls, you must follow it's guidance. You must follow the hoot of the owls and the sounds of the wolves.
		\item[Guidence of Space] The correct path points to the stars. Follow the hills up and not down.
		\item[Guidence of Energy] The forest seeks to distract. Avoid illusions created by the energy stone.
		\item[Guidence of the Trinity] When the trinity is broken, search for the missing link. When two of the rules above are broken, look for the third to act.

\subsection{NPC's}

All of the creatures that can appear in The Pluvian forest are the same as those of Rem Silva Except the night elves and Rexxar/Bella. Similarly, the party can encounter a number of various other creatures.

\subsection{Encounters and Discoveries}

Throughout the forest, many things can happen to the party including visions/dreams, strange occurrences, interesting discoveries, and more.

\begin{commentbox}{Fountain of Plasma}
	Within the forest there exists a circular three layer fountain. It is rather large and contains a thick glowing liquid. The liquid is clear like water, but also warm to the touch and flows slowly in reverse as it would in a normal fountain. The fountain has an extreme index of refraction and so it appears as though it is only a few inches deep. However, the players can reach their entire arms into the fountain if they so choose.
	
	Within the fountain is a scroll that can only be acquired by reaching deep into the fountain and grabbing some of the water then pulling their hand out. If they grab the deep water, a scroll will materialize from the liquid as it hits the air. The scroll that materializes is known as the Scroll of Myrd.
\end{commentbox}


\begin{commentbox}{Scroll of Myrd}
	The scroll of Myrd has a sweet aroma. The scroll itself contains an indecipherable language that appears to have a different character for each letter. this is unreadable by any sense. The key to understanding the scroll is to eat the scroll. If the scroll is eaten, it is bitter to the taste (worse than pure cranberries). When consumed, the devourer will gain the understanding of the scroll.	
\end{commentbox}


\begin{commentbox}{Riddle of Myrd}
	The Riddle of Myrd is a piece of information that Baba has. She will give it to the party to aid on their journey through the Pluvian Forest.
	\begin{quote}
		Within the Pluvian realm, one must focus at the helm.
		
		For the puzzle of the forest, fall hidden in the water crest.
		
		There the scroll of exit may be found, and escape contained in what is round.
		
		The soul of your being in danger now, the secret way, you must find how.
		
		To save the soul, one must devour the scroll.
		
		For the knowledge of what's next, is contained within its text.
		
		And the power of this word, is greater than that heard.
		
		To escape this place, and win the race.

Xur'la is a physical `god' created by Myrddin. Xur'la was created as a being to perform specific duties only a deity could perform.

\section{Avalon}

This quest line begins with the tablet of apples (since Avalon translates to isle of apples) which contains old encrypted text. How the party acquires the tablet can vary greatly based on the decisions they make. One such way is that the Tablet is in the possession of the librarian in the Tempestas royal library. Dastan or any other NPC can lead the party here to acquire it before leaving Tempestas. Or the party can hear about it from elsewhere and make there way there. An alternate idea is through Vala Mal'Doran.

It begins with a woman named Vala Mal'Doran who has an ancient tablet supposedly leading to an ancient treasure. Vala holds two bracelets that can be placed on a member of the party and herself linking them. If they lead too far from one another or take damage, the other also takes the damage or feels the same effect. Vala can use these bracelets to ensure she is taken along to find the treasure. The tablet reads as follows.

This tablet cannot be understood without the correct verbal password. When it is attempted to be read by any spell, the letters will shift positions and shapes and not make sense to the reader. When the world ``Avalon'' is spoken, the word Avalon on the tablet will light up and the Tablet will become readable. It will appear to the reader as follows.

\begin{center}
	sa we leda obrisamsu  
	
	ot teh Vlae fo vaalno. 
	
	het caonisens to stripi, 
	
	tath eh ash fenogroe. 
	
	het kye of oen thrut, 
	
	eon tuthr nad on orem.

The letters on this are scrambled in such a way that it is phonetically readable, which can be used in the campaign as a password or something similar. However, each word is a scrambled version of a real word and when solved, it properly reads.

\begin{center}
	As we lead Ambrosius 
	
	to the Vale of Avalon.
	
	The ascension to spirit,
	
	that he has foregone.
	
	The key of one truth,
	
	one truth and no more.
	
	Whence his ancient treasures 
	
	are left as not needed therefore.
	
	The entrance is sealed,
	
	to all those of unwise.
	
	For the name of the chamber,
	
	is the key to the disguise.

Myrddin can also be translated to Merlin pertaining to the story of King Arthur (Ambrosius) and the Knights of the Round table. Avalon can then be placed wherever the DM desires. The entrance to Avalon can be entered via a teleportation system. The system is activated by the phrase "Avalon" when the correct location is found. Teleportation to an ancient cave will then occur. Once inside, the walls will be illuminated by a water fractal as if underwater (the pattern of water reflecting from waves) but surroundings of rock is all that is seen. Two hallways verge off from the chamber.

A square stone sits elevated from the rest of the cavern and when the party looks upon it, a sword appears (the sword in the stone). The sword has a jewel on its hilt and is of impeccable craftsmanship. When trying to pull the sword, a hologram of merlin will appear and speak the following. The sword is not removable.

\begin{center}
	Welcome ye knights of the round table.
	
	Men of honor followers of the path of righteousness
	
	Only those with wealth of knowledge
	
	and truth of spirit shall be given access to the underworld.
	
	The storehouse of riches of Ambrosius Borealis. 
	
	Prove ye worthy and all shall be revealed.
\end{center}

Of the two pathways leading from the chamber are two rooms (one from each hall). When entering each room, the entrance will be sealed with a stone wall. In the first room are two pots, one of silver and one of gold. The gold pot has the following writing under it (The universe is infinite). 

\begin{center}
	{\Large\fontspec{Anquietas} The universe is infinite}
\end{center}

The silver pot has the following writing under it (The treasure is in this pot).

\begin{center}
	{\Large\fontspec{Anquietas} The treasure is in this pot}
\end{center}

The key to getting this is that there is only one truth (from the tablet). The universe is infinite is the truth, and so the treasure is in that pot. Inside will be a gold coin (only if that pot is opened first). If it is not opened first, they will both be empty until the puzzle is reset. In the second room are 10 numbers written on stones all reflected upon each other which appears to form new symbols. Each number appears on a stone and need to be rearranged in the numerical order. Underneath the stones is the writing (Reflection onto the numeric).

\begin{center}
	{\Large\fontspec{Anquietas} Reflection onto the numeric}
\end{center}

In either room, if the puzzle is messed up, the ceiling will start to collapse until the puzzle is completed. When finished, the sword in the stone will be removable. When removing the sword, a hologram knight appears. The only interaction with the sword and the knight can be between the sword puller and the knight must be defeated. All other members will phase through the knight. In order to finish the puzzle after defeating the knight, the sword must be returned. The jewel on the hilt will glow and treasure will appear all around the room. However, this will not work until Vala returns the gold coin she stole from the pots. If the members attempt to leave the cave, the cave will collapse if Vala still has the gold coin (the truth of spirit test). She can suggest perhaps only the sword puller needs to be in the cave for the puzzle to complete which can lead them to leaving. Once she returns the coin and the sword is returned the treasure appears. If the sword is thrown or passed to anyone else, it goes through them. If the sword is never returned the player can have a new (fairly good) sword but the party misses out on all the treasures which can vary widely.

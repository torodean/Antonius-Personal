\section{Old Gods}

The old gods exist prior to the Celestials and well known gods of the world. These gods have an origin that could be from any point in history and from any place in history far before the existence of modern life on Orilla. These gods were of the first ascended beings in the universe. the Old gods of Orilla have lived for what could be seen as eternity and have long since decided to slumber and not interact with the mortal realm. Their power and abilities are far superior to any other beings in the universe and even as they slumber they can still greatly influence the mortal realms and even that of the ascended beings (modern gods).

\subsection{Yogg'Saron}

Yogg'Saron\footnote{Modeled after Yogg'Saron from World of Warcraft.} is an old god based on insanity. Yogg'Saron has been slumbering for the entire entire existence of life on Orilla. Even though he has been slumbering, his influence is so great that some creatures in the past have been driven insane by his mental influence and became servants embodying his essence in physical form. These servants have caused destruction and chaos throughout ancient times and left remnants of power that can still be found today. 

Yogg'Saron's most powerful influence was through a great beast that is believed by many to have been the entire essence of Yogg. The beast was vanquished by an army of highly trained soldiers with the help of a demigod Ursoc, whom described him as ``the beast with a thousand maws.'' The beast had such a strong influence from Yogg, that the blood of the creature was used for forging great and powerful items following the beasts defeat. Unfortunately, as the blood was also influenced by Yogg, the items created with the beasts blood have an inherent connection to Yogg.

Yogg'Sarons existence is believed to be unknown to most of the inhabitants of Orilla. However, Yogg's power is so vast that the maddening, destructive taint seeps from its resting place and appears to tear at the sanity of an unknown number of Orilla's inhabitants. Because of this, Yogg possess worshipers across all the world's peoples and cultures.

\subsubsection{Yogg'Saron Puzzle Box}

The Yogg'Saron puzzle box\footnote{From https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle\_Box\_of\_Yogg-Saron} is an artifact that was created with a connection to Yogg'Saron. The box is magically sealed and contains many shifting panels, hidden hinges, changing sides, magical barriers and more. The box is made of an allow of hardened Yogg'Saron blood and a substance called Katchin\footnote{Katchin from Dragonball Z.}, which is one of the hardest materials in the universe. The box is indestructible and appears impossible to actually solve and open. When attempting to open the box, the box will whisper messages to you to try and drive the user to insanity.

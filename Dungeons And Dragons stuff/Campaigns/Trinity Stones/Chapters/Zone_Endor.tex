\section{Endor (Moon)}

Endor is one of the two moons orbiting Orilla. Endor is where Camelot is located as a town/civilization established by Myrrdin. After Terra-forming Endor, a small group of individuals have been able to exist here to live by the law laid out by Myrddin. The moon itself is mainly dense forest and jungle region with some small mountains and a few open plains. There is limited wildlife other than what the villagers shepherd and breed.

\section{Distress of Tel'Drassil} \label{sec:Belshrak Nie}

Tel'Drassil is a large island home to a race of night elves. On the shores of Statu or elsewhere if needed, the party can come across a bottle with a message inside. This bottle can also contain a map of Orilla or of the surrounding areas if the party has not acquired one as of yet. The message in the bottle is written in elvish and is as follows. 


\begin{center}
	{\fontspec{Rellanic} 
		Captain Belshrak Nie leader of the QuelDanas seventy third patrol B.
		
		To the Queen of Darnassus and Commander ElRaj of the Darnassian Infantry Council.
		
		We began our thorough diplomatic scouting visit of Castiana. Unfortunately it appeared as though since our last visit last century they have taken off as far as technological advancement go. After attempting to rely on our usual stealth techniques to gather more intelligence we were discovered and taken to be a threat. A fleet of ships hunted down and destroyed our scout ships with weapons unlike those weve seen before. Me and my crew were captured and imprisoned for weeks while tortured and sheered of information. We believe that they know the location of TelDrassil from our ship documents and may be headed that way with an invasion force. They seem completely hostile to all those who oppose their gods. To anyone who finds this letter please get this warning to TelDrassil and any other people throughout Orilla who may need the warning as soon as possible. War may be inevitable.

If the party manages to detour the campaign and somehow make it to Tel'Drassil, they will arrive with the region on fire and under siege by the Celestials. The ships attacking Tel'Drassil will be far advanced compared to any ships the party has seen.

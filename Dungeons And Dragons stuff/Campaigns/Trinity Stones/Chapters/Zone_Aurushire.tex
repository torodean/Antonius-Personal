\section{Aurushire}

Aurushire (also commonly referred to as Goldshire) is a small village located on the southern end of the Statu peninsula. Just East of Aurushire is a large mountain containing mine shafts used for gold mining. It is not well known, other by those who work in the mines, but strange things happen within these mines where mined gold will spontaneously be regrown after being removed from the mines. This phenomenon is where Aurushire (Goldshire) retreived its name from and is thought to be related to the spacial occurrences reported in The Pluvian Forest. 

\subsection{NPC's}

Aurushire is full of NPC characters. Many of them are just normal workers or village folk, however some serve an important purposes. Some of them include the innkeeper, the Pandaren Brothers, the village watchers and the shopkeepers.

\subsection{Bob's Guns}

Bob's Guns is a relatively newly built shop. The majority of what is sold here is ranged weapons. Due to the effects of the Pluvian Forest, Bob (the storekeeper) discovered a weapon laying in the wild on someones corpse. He was able t reverse engineer approximately how it worked and has been creating 'guns' ever since. Unfortunately he used all of the bullets on the original design, but he was able to examine the weapon itself and deduce a process to recreate a similar mechanism, His own designs are not as well made as the original discovery, but they are slowly improving over time. Bob also sells spears, throwing stars, darts, bows and more.

\subsection{Stormstout Blacksmith}

This is the village blacksmith that is run by one of the Stormstout brothers (Mishnah). The blacksmith is one of the watchers of the village and most influential members. Mishnah is also friends with everyone else in the village and generally his services are needed by almost all of the members.

Ekron is one of the watchers of the village.

\subsection{Library of Lysanias}

The village has a library that is open to all. There are a number of people who spend a lot of time here and maintain it but for the most part it is open and there is no main keeper. The library is public and contains mostly learning material and books written by previous and past villagers.

\section{Aurushire}

Aurushire (also commonly referred to as Goldshire) is a small village located on the southern end of the Statu peninsula. Just East of Aurushire is a large mountain containing mine shafts used for gold mining. It is not well known, other by those who work in the mines, but strange things happen within these mines where mined gold will spontaneously be regrown after being removed from the mines. This phenomenon is where Aurushire (Goldshire) retreived its name from and is thought to be related to the spacial occurrences reported in The Pluvian Forest.

The East side of the village is the location of Auru Convallis and the Naga camps are on the southeast side of the area leading into the eastern forest.}

Unfortunately he used all of the bullets on the original design, but he was able to examine the weapon itself and deduce a process to recreate a similar mechanism, His own designs are not as well made as the original discovery, but they are slowly improving over time. Bob also sells spears, throwing stars, darts, bows and more.

The library is public and contains mostly learning material and books written by previous and past villagers. Many of the books found in this place are old and have not been touched in years.

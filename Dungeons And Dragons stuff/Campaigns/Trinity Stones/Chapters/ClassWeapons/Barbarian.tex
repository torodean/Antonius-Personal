\subsubsection{Strom'kar the Warbreaker}

Strom'kar the Warbreaker is an ancient weapon of legend. It is said to have been forged in the lava's underneath the rumored great city of Ironforge. To contain the energies that dance across its cold edges, Shadowmourne was believed to have been hewn from piles of impure Saronite and the hardened blood of the Old God, Yogg-Saron. The weapon is said to have been forged by a group of master blacksmiths and weapon artisans. The weapon was wielded by the Dwarven kings in the times when Ironforge was at its prime. It is said that this weapon was used particularly by a great king Gimly Branbeard whom used the weapon to slay an enchanted ice dragon that was mind controlled and sent onto the city of Ironforge by the Lich King. Rumor has it that this weapon was buried with the King as it's power became too great for anyone to wield. The weapon in the legends is believed to have absorbed the essence of the ice dragon after its defeat.

\subsubsection{Ashbringer}

It is said that the righteousness of a man is determined by his ability to resist temptations and instead seek what is good for others. Legend has it that true righteousness has only ever been known by one man. An ancient king of Dalaran named Uther. They called him the light-bringer for his righteous acts. Uther reigned from a young boy after his father was killed in battle. He spent his life focused on maintaining peace from attacks from alternate realms and dimensions. It is believed that he was so charismatic that under his reign there was a one rule government. At the end of his life, he was blessed with the opportunity to ascend to a higher plane of existence due to his righteous acts. Upon doing so, he imbued his weapon, Ashbringer, with all of his physical abilities as he shed his body of his soul. It is said that he did this in the catacombs of Ironforge, the great capitol city that they ruled from in these times. The City is said to have been destroyed following the days of his reign when the world broke out into an age changing war. After centuries, all but remains of Ashbringer is but a legend.

\subsubsection{Potential}

The Ashbringer weapon wants to be wielded by a righteous character. 

\begin{commentbox}{Ashbringer\footnote{Some information taken from https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/351998-the-ashbringer}\footnote{Weapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement by a paladin)}}
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an enemy you will deal 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage. The damage will change to d10's if the target is a fiend or an undead.
	
	When you take damage while wielding the Ashbringer, you can heal one target within 50 yards for a single roll of the dice closes to the wielders level (round up).
	
	While a paladin wields The Ashbringer in combat it will look like the paladin is burning with a holy flame. Any fiend or undead that attacks the wielder will take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage. When the wielder rolls a 20 against a fiends or an undead the wielder must a d100 roll. If the roll is less than half the wielders level then the fiend or undead will burn in holy flame and turn to ash immediately.
	
	If a paladin of an evil alignment tries to attune to The Ashbringer they have to make a d20 roll. At a 18 or below The Ashbringer will reject you and deal 3d10 fire damage and 2d10 radiant damage. At a 19 or 20 you over power the will of the weapon and make it yours.
	
	With a successful roll to overcome the will of The Ashbringer while having an evil alignment will make The Ashbringers appearance will start to dull and become darker until it becomes fully corrupt. It will regain its former glory when its attuned to a paladin of a non evil alignment.
	
	Proficiency with a greatsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
	
	If the wielder of Ashbringer dies (by failing three death saves) then the life essence of the blade can leave the weapon and resurrect the player to full. The weapon after this point becomes useless.

\subsubsection{Finding Ashbringer}

Ashbringer is located in an underground vault within the city of Ironforge. Ironforge is located within the Pluvian Forest and has been hidden with time. Ironforge can only be spotted when winter. The snow covering the entrance is slightly melted from the super-heated thermal activities under the cities. The city is mainly collapsed but can be traversed if found. The main gate to the city is closed, but from an avalanche of rocks, part of it is accessible on one side. The Pluvian Forest contains a section stuck in time during an eternal winter, within this winter is where Ironforge is located. From the outside (space-view) this region appears normal, however upon a creature entering this large region, they are transported into a past time when it is winter.

\end{center}

When entering Ironforge, the air is warm and a significant amount of steam is present rising from the thermal ducts throughout the city. The ducts in this state are full of lava that have broken through the lower gates of the vents. Within the center of the city is the kings chamber, where passage to the lower vaults is. Ashbringer is located in the depths of the vault. The vault is a series of large/high paths overlooking magma and lava pits that bubble and steam continually. The area is extremely warm. When approaching Ashbringer, the party will encounter the Firelord Ragnaros. Ragnaros will stop fighting if someone can successfully wield The Ashbringer weapon but will otherwise attack the party and chase them out of the vault.

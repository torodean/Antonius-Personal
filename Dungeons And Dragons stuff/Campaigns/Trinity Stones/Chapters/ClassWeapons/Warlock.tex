\subsubsection{Spine of the Condemned}

According to legend, a powerful warlock named Kael'thas teamed up with a powerful Wizard named Xavius in studying alternate realms and dimensions. Kael'thas opened a portal to a demonic realm and saught the power that the creatures within it possessed. In an attempt to control the beings from that realm, he trapped their souls in a magical crystal. The crystal contained the essence of the creatures but the power was unable to be used until Xavius crafted a staff to connect with the power of the crystal. Unfortunately, with the dark ways of Xavius' sorcery, the process required a trusting soul, in which Kael'thas was consumed to the staff. Later named the Spine of the Condemned, it is said that Kael'thas' essence is trapped within the soul and along with its wielder, can tap the potential of the demonic souls that are contained within the Spines crystal. The great Wizard Xavius is legend to have gone mad from his own creations and lose all knowledge of his magical creations. The Spine of the Condemned is said to have vanished along with all of his other dark creations of the time.

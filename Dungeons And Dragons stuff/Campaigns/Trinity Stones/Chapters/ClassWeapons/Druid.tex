\subsubsection{Staff of Elune}

The Staff of Elune is a staff of legend among the night elves. The staff is believed to have been wielded by an ancient night elf druid named Elune that had an unrivaled connection with nature. As the legend puts it, this night elf went on to become the spirit of the forest that has only been rumored to exist. Elune is believed to have gave birth to the World Tree Nordrassil, which lead to the growth of Tel'drassil, which is the current homeland of the elves. Nordrassil is a tree of legend that lead to the longevity fo the elves and provided a home for the first elves as they grew in knowledge of nature. The tree is said to have been destroyed in an ancient war; however branches from it were planted and used to grow Tel'drassil. It is believed that Elune was the one to preserve these branches during the great world war of the time and in the process of planting Tel'drassil, Elune's spirit became that of the forest and her body fossilized into the Staff of Elune.

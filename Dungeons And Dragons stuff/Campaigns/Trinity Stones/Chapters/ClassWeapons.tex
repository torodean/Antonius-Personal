\subsection{Introduction to Class Weapons}

Class weapons are weapons of great power that can only be wielded by certain classes. Each weapon has a back story of where it came from and how it received it's powers. The weapons, will provide enhanced abilities for anyone that is successful in wielding them. The weapons all have consciousnesses imbued within them and must accept the wielder as worthy in order for the potential of the weapon to be unleashed.

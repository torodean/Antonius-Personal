\chapter{Milton Manastorm Backstory}

Milton Manastorm comes from the Manastorm bloodline and is the twin brother to Millhouse Manastorm. Milton began studying Magic with his twin brother and continued to do so for years. They stuck together for most of their adventures. Of the two, Milton was the practival one who did the majority of work. He learned easier than Millhouse and was able to apply knowledge on a much more realistic level. On the otherwise, Millhouse was similarly just as powerful, but more interested in learning spells such as impending doom, with significantly unpractical cast times. Through their adventures, Milton was always saving his brother from the messes he would get into, secretly enjoying hte chaotic lifestyle they both lived.

Millhouse had a dream as a young boy to become a mage, a wizard. Milton had a similar dream, however he knew his brothers ego would not let them both do the same thing and thus Milton decided to become a sorcerer, allowing his brother to glory in his own self worth (as he saw wizards as the superior beings). As young boys they entered schools of magic, where they were both kicked out. Their mischief (especially when together) was more than the master sorceres and wizards could handle (mentally not physically). The skills and ability to learn magic for the twins was unrivaled. The bond of their bloodline gives them an increased interest and desire to constantly one up each other and enables them to pick up magic very simply.

Together, both the twins traveled all over hunting for rare and priceless artifacts. This was a sort of hobby for them. One day when trying to steal an ancient relic from a mysterious Naaru vessel, the two managed to find themselves split. Millhouse was sent to Arcatraz, a place of imprisonment for dangerous beings the Naaru encountered. He essentially became a stowaway who was in the wrong Naaru vessel at the wrong time. Milton on the other hand, who was similarly on that vessel, tried to escape from the encounter by casting plane shift. Unfortunately the Naaru, who were beings they knew virtually nothing about, caused some interrupting spell which cast Milton onto a far away plane, losing track of his brother. Since this point, they have been on separate paths.

When they were still young, the twins realized how much of a burden and flaw it was to rely on an arcane focus. Unfortunately they were unable to determine a way of not having to have one, but they did solve the flaw in having it be removable. Through a process the twins discovered while trapped (to be used as dinner) in an Orak camp, they found a way to embedd their arcane focus' as part of themselves.  The skin is cut with an Orak knife and pure molten gold is poured into the wound, which was a method the Orak used for tattooing the higher ranking members. Upon killing all members of the camp, they took the needed materials they looted, including the gold, and took it to an acquaintance they had traded a rare artifact to in Aurushire a few months back. This acquaintance was able to safely and very accurately perform this process. 

Milton had two different castings, one on the back of each hand. On the right hand, a hexagon gold cast was poured into his skin, a light red ruby lining with a white crystal in the center sealed in by the gold cast. On the left, a heptagon gold cast, with a dark violet ruby lining, and a black crystal in the center sealed in by the gold cast. On a prior expedition, when the twins were captured to be sacrificed in a village of dark monks, they took note of a balance the monks drew their power from. A balance of light and dark which gave these monks a harmony of power. After freeing themselves and destroying all of the monks, they acquired the most powerful stones from the leaders of the village. The white and black crystals are to represent the different sides of nature and the twins believed if they could harness their power in unison it would give them an enhanced balance of power. Since this time, they have been using the crystals as their arcane focus'.

As it stands, Milton is simply exploring the world, collecting rare and priceless artifacts, learning to increase his power/influence, and finding his brother. 

\chapter{Skills and Features}

\begin{paperbox}[float=!t]{Source of Power}
	The Manastorm bloodline has long been attuned with magic. The source of Milton's power comes from his magical bloodline. Unlike his brother Millhouse, Milton understands this. It does not give him a sense of weakness though. The strong background gives Milton the idea that he is able to do whatever it is he desires.

\hspace{1cm}I am excited to be applying to this position at the Applied Research Laboratories. I have recently been looking for either a job that I will enjoy settling into as a career or a temporary job that will hold me over until I can apply to graduate schools this coming year. Fortunately, this opportunity as a Software Development Engineering Scientist Associate presented itself as both simultaneously. The idea of being able to work at a research place under the department of defense and possibly pursuing graduate school at the same time is something I definitely want to see if I am able to secure an opportunity for.

\hspace{1cm}In my most recent professional endeavors, I have gained valuable skills that have given me the ability to adapt to a new position such as this one perfectly. I developed my research skills pertaining to engineering and development of new technologies. The opportunity arose to enhance my C++, C\#, python, and GUI design capabilities which lead to the design of a software package for a national lab and a helpful application for use in a university IT department. Alongside this I was able to branch out and experience new skills such as LabVIEW programming and makefile creation all while maintaining comprehensive documentation via \LaTeX produced manuals. These skills and others are showcased on my personal website which I designed to showcase my projects and skills.

\hspace{1cm}My past experience involving the above skills most recently includes nuclear astrophysics research at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory where I worked a summer position in research and continued my research for the following year until graduation. This research eventually lead to a published physics paper relating to the software package I created for the lab. Alongside this opportunity, and while attending Michigan State University as a full-time physics and mathematics student, I also worked with the IT department for multiple departments on campus. These experiences provided independent projects as well as given tasks which were regularly worked on an performed. Other relevant experience before these two positions include another research position at Oakland University and a tutoring position at Oakland Community College where I first started to really develop my skills using markup languages and later programming languages.

\hspace{1cm}With all these past experiences, including my degrees in physics and mathematics, it is clear that a research position is the correct path that I want to lead towards. This opportunity would provide the opportunity to learn about new technologies and give myself the opportunity to make an impact on the advancement of the global positioning systems. The nature of the role would be a great fit for the enjoyment I have always sought in continually developing and improving on my own work and knowledge which is why I am hopeful and excited to be considered for this role.
